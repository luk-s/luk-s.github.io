## About Me

Hi, I'm Lukas!

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) supervised by [Prof. Florian Tramèr](https://floriantramer.com/). My research focuses on making AI systems safe(r). My research interests cover both, theoretical and empirical work, and include a diverse set of topics such as model evaluation, red-teaming, interpretability, reinforcement learning and science of deep learning.

Before starting my PhD I obtained a BSc degree in Computer Science and a MSc degree in Data Science (both ETH Zurich) and completed research internships at the University of Cambridge and UC Berkeley.
